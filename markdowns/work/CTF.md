# Toward Building a Secure Competitive Learning Platform for Computer Science Technical Challenges

This project was developed as my **final bachelor's thesis in Software Engineering**. It introduces a secure, CTF-style learning and evaluation platform tailored for cybersecurity education and recruitment. Inspired by platforms like **TryHackMe**, it supports challenge-based learning, talent evaluation, and collaborative engagement.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The platform is designed to:
- Bridge the gap between theory and practical cybersecurity skills
- Enable **instructors** to create interactive, real-world-based challenges
- Allow **recruiters** to run competitive, skill-based evaluations
- Provide learners with gamified progress tracking and job opportunities

It follows a full software engineering lifecycle — from **requirement analysis** and **UML modeling** to **implementation** using scalable web technologies.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🧩 **Challenge Creation**: Instructors can build step-by-step tasks with scoring and hints
- 🧑‍💻 **User Roles**: Supports students, instructors, recruiters, and analysts
- 🧪 **CTF-Style Competitions**: Companies can post job-related challenges and monitor participants
- 📊 **Gamification**: Badges, leaderboards, and progress tracking to encourage learning
- 📂 **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with maintainable components
- 🔒 **Security-focused Design**: Secure authentication, access control, and sandboxing support

## 🧪 Development Lifecycle

- **Requirement Analysis**:
  - Market research on HackerRank, TryHackMe, Tianchi
  - Identified user needs, actors, use cases, and functional specifications
- **Modeling & Design**:
  - Use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, domain class models
  - Database schema and component-level architecture
- **Implementation**:
  - Built core modules: login, challenge creation, participation, job posting
  - UI/UX developed with responsive Vue components
- **Gamification System**:
  - Badges, leaderboard, ratings
  - Tracking challenge completion and user activity

- `/images/projects/cyber-learning-platform/challenge-creation.png` – Instructor challenge editor
- `/images/projects/cyber-learning-platform/competition-view.png` – Recruiter competition dashboard

---

## 🧑‍💼 My Role

I led the **full-stack development**, system architecture, and lifecycle management:
- Designed the platform structure using UML
- Developed core features across backend and frontend
- Integrated gamification and secure role-based access
- Managed version control and testing pipelines

---

## 🚀 Outcome

- A scalable, secure, and extensible platform
- Demonstrated real-world value in education and recruitment use cases
- Set a foundation for future extensions like challenge marketplaces and XSS/SQLi sandbox labs

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Cloud deployment for scalability (AWS/GCP)
- Real-time collaborative solving sessions
- Expand challenge library with community submissions
- Advanced analytics for recruiters and instructors
